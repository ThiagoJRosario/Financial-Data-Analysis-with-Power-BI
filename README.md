# Financial-Data-Analysis-with-Power-BI

In this mini-project, we explore various Power BI functionalities within the finance domain. The business scenario involves a company seeking insights into its revenue and expenses through a dashboard that provides a clear view of key financial metrics.

The dashboard addresses the following financial indicators:

Total Revenue
Total Expenses
Profit Margin
Total Revenue by Component
Total Expenses by Component relative to the average expenses
Total Revenue and Expenses by Component and Year, with a Type/Component hierarchy
Additionally, the company needs to identify segments where revenues and expenses are the highest and lowest, to inform its strategic planning. This analysis enables decision-makers to allocate resources effectively and optimize financial performance across different segments.
